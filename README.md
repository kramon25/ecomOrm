# ecomOrm

DESCRIPTION: This e-commerce app is developed using starter code to build a back-end application for an e-commerce site that uses the command line interface and object-relational mapping for various methods of data manipulation, storage, and retrieval when using HTTP methods. It uses Express.js API which uses Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database in order to build a back end for the shop's website.
